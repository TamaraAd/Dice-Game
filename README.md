# 🎲 Dicee Game

This is a simple and fun **2-player dice game** I built while learning JavaScript and DOM manipulation. Every time the page is refreshed, each player rolls a die — the player with the higher number wins!

## 🛠️ Built With

- **HTML5**
- **CSS3**
- **JavaScript**

## 🚀 How It Works

1. Open the webpage.
2. Refresh the page.
3. Two dice images are randomly updated to show a roll from 1 to 6.
4. The title updates to declare the winner (or a draw if both players roll the same number).
